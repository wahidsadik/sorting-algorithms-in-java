sorting-algorithms-in-java
==========================

This is a personal project with the following objective:
* Create sorting algorithms in java and compare their performances

Please feel free to download the code.

I've used Apache Buildr (http://buildr.apache.org/) to create the initial project. For the first time user, I would recommend these pages to install Buildr. For me, it took 5 minutes to install on my mac (jruby and then buildr).
